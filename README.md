# Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning and Explainable AI

This project focuses on the prediction of Parkinson's Disease using biomedical voice features. It implements supervised machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, SVM) alongside Explainable AI (XAI) tools such as SHAP and LIME to ensure transparency and interpretability in healthcare diagnostics.

## üß∞ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Models:** Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Explainability:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME  
- **Development Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

## üß™ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalization & feature scaling
   - Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Train-Test Split

2. **Model Training**
   - Random Forest
   - SVM (with hyperparameter tuning)

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

4. **Model Explainability**
   - SHAP for global and instance-level feature importance
   - LIME for local prediction interpretation

## üîç Explainable AI (XAI)

Given the critical nature of healthcare applications, we integrated XAI techniques:
- **SHAP:** Quantifies the impact of each feature on the model‚Äôs prediction.
- **LIME:** Explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally.
